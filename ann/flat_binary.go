// FlatBinary is Flat with a two-stage scan: a 1-bit sign-quantized Hamming
// PREFILTER over the whole corpus, then an EXACT float32 rerank of the
// survivors. It exposes the same Hit / Query(q, k) shape as Flat and FlatI8.
//
// What it trades. This is the first index in the package whose result set is
// APPROXIMATE — Flat and FlatI8 both score every vector and are exact over
// their respective score functions. Here the true top-k can be missed outright
// if the prefilter does not rank it in the top Overquery·k by Hamming distance.
// The scores that come back are exact (same kernel Flat uses); the membership
// is not.
//
// What it buys. Only the SCAN shrinks, not the index: the float32 vectors are
// still held for the rerank, and the codes add dim/8 bytes per vector on top —
// about 3% at dim 768. If it is memory you need, FlatI8 is the sibling that
// gives you a quarter of the bytes — or FlatBinaryI8, which composes the same
// binary prefilter with FlatI8's int8 rerank instead of this type's float32
// one, for dim/8 + dim bytes total rather than this type's dim/8 + 4·dim. What
// this gives you is a first stage that reads 96 B per candidate instead of
// 3072 B, measured at 14× the throughput of the exact scan on this corpus
// shape (perf-campaign item 38).
//
// It composes with embed.Truncate rather than competing with it: truncating to
// dim d shrinks both stages, and the prefilter's cost is linear in d.
//
// One shape where it does NOT pay: a very small candidate set. The prefilter
// materializes a distance per document and makes a second pass over them, which
// at overquery·k below roughly 100 on a 200k corpus costs more than the
// heap-based selection the filtered path uses — measured at 877 µs against
// 614 µs for k=10, overquery 4 (BenchmarkFlatBinaryPrefilterPaths). Above that
// the counting sort wins by 1.4× to 6×, and it is flat in overquery where the
// heap is not. The dispatch is on the presence of a filter alone rather than on
// a fitted candidate-count threshold, because that crossover was measured at
// one corpus size on one machine and scales with n.
//
// Like Flat, a built *FlatBinary is read-only and Query is safe to call
// concurrently; the constructors are the single-threaded builders.
