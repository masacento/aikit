// Command scriptsguard backs two campaign claims about scripts/ with derivable rules rather than
// hand-kept lists, so neither can silently regress:
//
//	PYTHON — every .py under scripts/ lives in exactly one declared category; a stray .py directly
//	under scripts/ (the residue the zero-Python campaign removed) fails.
//	  scripts/oracle/   — reference generators that reach external ecosystems Go has no equivalent
//	                      for: PyTorch/HF goldens, and llama.cpp's ggml grid tables. Irreducible.
//	  scripts/fixtures/ — kept on cost grounds, reducible in principle: prep_beir.py fetches an HF
//	                      parquet dataset for a manual benchmark; porting it would add a parquet
//	                      dependency for no gate. Reviewable.
//
//	SHELL — NO .sh anywhere under scripts/. Every deciding-shell gate was migrated to a Go command
//	under tools/ (the shell-to-zero campaign); scripts/ holds declared Python and nothing else. A
//	.sh reappearing under scripts/ is a deciding gate that skipped tools/ — it fails. (The gpu/
//	CUDA build toolchain — build_ptx.sh + nvrtc_compile.py, NVRTC via a C library Go has no
//	build-time binding for, shared verbatim with goinfer — is separate build infrastructure, out
//	of scope by the scripts/ boundary.)
//
// Both rules are derived by path, so nothing is hand-enumerated: adding a pin_ script to
// oracle/ needs no edit here. (This cites the same "derived by path, not hand-enumerated"
// argument as B7 once did — that tag no longer resolves to anything in the archived perf-
// campaign docs, so it's dropped rather than left pointing nowhere; see docs/architecture.md
// § Numbered-citation index.) The DENOMINATOR is printed so a pass and a scan-of-nothing differ.
// Usage: go run -C tools ./scriptsguard
