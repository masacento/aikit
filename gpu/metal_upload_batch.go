// HostCopy is one host→device pair for UploadBatch: Src's bytes go into Dst at
// Dst's bind offset (Buffer.At).
//
// Src is []byte rather than a generic []T because a batch is heterogeneous by
// nature — the motivating caller loads an expert's f32 weights and its f16 scales
// in the same pass — and a generic batch would force one element type across all
// of them. Upload[T] stays generic; this is the byte-level sibling.
type HostCopy struct {

// UploadBatch uploads every pair.
//
// ON METAL THERE IS NO SYNCHRONIZE TO AMORTIZE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE
// CUDA VERSION — so this buys nothing here and does not pretend to. Apple Silicon
// is UMA: Upload is already a plain copy() into selContents-mapped memory with no
// transfer and no fence, so a batch of N is N copies either way. The saving on CUDA
// is ~240 device synchronizes per MoE decode token (~3.6 ms of 64 ms); the
// equivalent number here is zero, because there were never any.
//
// It exists so a consumer targeting both backends writes one call rather than a
// build-tagged branch, and so the two backends validate identically. See
// cuda_upload_batch.go for the measurements and the reasoning.
//
// Every pair is validated before any bytes move, matching the CUDA half: a bad pair
// fails without leaving the batch half-applied.
