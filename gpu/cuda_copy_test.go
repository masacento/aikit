// trafficGBs converts bytes COPIED into memory TRAFFIC, which is what the ceiling
// above actually bounds.
//
// WHY THIS FUNCTION EXISTS — IT IS A FACTOR OF TWO, AND IT BIT ME. A device-to-
// device copy reads n bytes and writes n bytes, so it moves 2n across the memory
// bus. peakBandwidthGBs is derived from clock × bus width, which is a bus-traffic
// figure. Comparing bytes-copied against it therefore understates utilisation by
// exactly 2×: the first version of this test measured a settled 166.6 GB/s on a
// 2070 SUPER and reported "37% of peak" for a copy that was really running at
// 333 GB/s of traffic, i.e. 74% — which is what the originating goinfer
// measurement meant when it said 347 GB/s / 78%.
//
// Both numbers are honest and neither is wrong; they answer different questions.
// Bytes-copied is what a caller budgets against ("how long to move my 20 MiB").
// Traffic is what the hardware ceiling bounds. Reporting only one of them, against
// the other's ceiling, is how two repos end up quoting numbers that differ by 2×
// forever without either being mistaken.

// TestCopyDevice_bandwidthUnderPhysicalCeiling is the gate for this whole change,
// and its job is to FAIL on an impossible number rather than print one.
//
// THE TRAP, in full, because every part of it pointed the wrong way. gocudrv's
// CopyToDevice/CopyToDeviceAt dispatch cuMemcpyDtoD_v2, whose name and whose own
// doc comment ("It blocks until the copy completes") both suggest the call
// returns when the bytes have landed. The CUDA driver defines DtoD as
// ASYNCHRONOUS with respect to the host, so it does not. Timing the call alone on
// 20 MiB measures ~9 µs of dispatch instead of ~116 µs of transfer, which
// computes to 8145 GB/s. That is not a suspicious throughput — it is roughly 18×
// a 2070 SUPER's physical maximum, i.e. impossible, and comparing against a
// device-derived ceiling is what surfaced it.
//
// So this test times copy AND synchronize together, and asserts the result is
// physically possible. A version that only printed the number would have printed
// 8145 GB/s and been believed.
