// TestDeviceCeilings measures the three roofs and logs them, and — this is the part
// that makes it a test rather than a benchmark — checks that the probes are measuring
// what they claim.
//
// THE SELF-CHECK IS THE POINT. A probe that reports a number cannot be trusted just
// because the number looks reasonable; that is exactly how the amd64 GEMM benchmark
// reported "~50% of peak" against another machine's constant for months. So:
//
//   - dp4a_peak and imad_peak run the SAME loop shape and the same chain count, and
//     differ only in whether the instruction retires 1 or 4 int8 MACs. Their
//     instruction rates must therefore be close. If dp4a's were far lower, the probe
//     would be measuring loop overhead or a dependency stall rather than issue rate,
//     and the 4x MAC advantage it reports would be fiction.
//   - stream_read must beat both probes' memory traffic by orders of magnitude (it is
//     the only one that touches DRAM in its loop) and must not exceed any plausible
//     bus. A figure above ~4 TB/s would mean the buffer fit in cache.
//
// The bounds are deliberately loose. This runs on whatever GPU is present, and the
// assertion worth making portably is "this probe is coherent", not "this device is
// fast". Exact figures for nvidia-rtx2070s are in docs/internal/roofline-2026-08.md.
